# Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs. 

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @ryanstew95/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@ryanstew95/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

head: Returns the first item in an array; undefined if the array is empty.

tail: Returns everything but the first item in an array; returns an empty array if provided array is empty.

middle: Returns the middle-most element(s) of a given array; for arrays with one or two elements, return an empty array.

letterPositions: Returns all the indicies (zero-based positions) in the string where each character is found.

findKeyByValue: Returns the first key containing the value of the inputted object and value. If no key with the given value is found, return undefined.

map: Returns a new array based on a map function which takes in two arguements: An array to map, and a callback function.

takeUntil: Returns a truthy value based on a given array and callback which are passed as parameters of the takeUntil function.

findKey: Returns a truthy value based on a given object and callback which are passed as parameters of the findKey function. If no key is found, return undefined.

eqObjects: comparing two objects to see if they have equal key values. 

eqArrays: comparing two arrays to see if the contents are the same.

assertObjectsEqual: testing different objects to see if its contents are of equal value. 

assertEqual: testing to see if both values are equal.

assertArraysEqual: testing to arrays to see if they are both equal.
